## Downloading and setting up
Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/rasvetovvv/Discord-CustomRP/releases) page and run the .exe installer! You can also use Windows Package Manager to install the program (`winget install rasvetovvv.CustomRP`) or, if you prefer the portable version, download the zip, unpack it somewhere, preferably in a separate folder, and start it up. Upon starting, you will be prompted to open a [setup manual](https://docs.customrp.xyz/setting-up). You can open it later by pressing F1 or going to Help -> Open Manual.
### Updating
If you installed the app, updating is literally as easy as running the installer for the newer version. If you use a portable version, please make sure to extract the updated files into the same folder as you did before to keep your settings.
### Troubleshooting & Feedback
If you have any problems with the app, please check out the [FAQ](http://customrpc.kesug.com/) first. If this doesn't help, or you have any  suggestions on making the app more functional, you can open an issue ticket, use Discussions, or join the Discord server, link is at the top of the readme.
